# Operators: Special symbols like -, + , * , /, etc.
# Operands: Value on which the operator is applied.


# Arithmetic Operators

# Comparison Operators
a = 13

print(a > b)
print(a < b)
print(a == b)
print(a != b)
print(a >= b)

# Logical Operators
a = True

# Bitwise Operators
a = 10

# Assignment Operators
a = 10
